## Problem 1

### Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel data sheet

``` r
# First, load necessary packages.

library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.2.1     v purrr   0.3.2
    ## v tibble  2.1.3     v dplyr   0.8.3
    ## v tidyr   1.0.0     v stringr 1.4.0
    ## v readr   1.3.1     v forcats 0.4.0

    ## -- Conflicts ---------------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Import excel file and name it 'p1_trash', specify sheet
# Omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes)
# Clean up variable names
# Omit rows where dumpster is missing
# Round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

p1_trash=read_excel(path="./data/healthyharbor_updated.xlsx", sheet=1, col_names = TRUE, range=cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate( 
      sports_balls =  as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits=0)))
```

### Read and clean precipitation data for 2017

``` r
# Read in 2017 sheet
# Clean variable names
# Omit rows without precipitation data
# Add a variable year (2017)
p1_2017 = read_excel(path="./data/healthyharbor_updated.xlsx", sheet=6, col_names = TRUE, skip=1, range="A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(precipitation=total) %>% 
  drop_na(precipitation) %>% 
  mutate(
    year=2017
  )
```

### Read and clean precipitation data for 2018

``` r
# Read in 2018 sheet
# Clean variable names
# Omit rows without precipitation data
# Add a variable year (2018)
p1_2018 = read_excel(path="./data/healthyharbor_updated.xlsx", sheet=5, col_names = TRUE, skip=1, range="A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(precipitation=total) %>% 
  drop_na(precipitation) %>% 
  mutate(
    year=2018
  )
```

### Combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable

``` r
p1_combined = 
  full_join(p1_2017, p1_2018) %>% 
  rename(
    month.name=month
  )
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "precipitation", "year")

### Write a paragraph about this data.

The number of observations in the 2017 precipitation dataset is 12. The
number of observations in the 2018 precipitation dataset is 12. The
primary variables in the datasets were month, precipitation, year. The
total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches. The median number of
sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
balls.

## Problem 2

### First, clean the data in pols-month.csv

``` r
# Import csv file, clean names, and separate 'mon' into 3 integer variables year, month, day
# Create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem, prez_gop,day variable
# Arrange politicians dataset by year and month

politicians_data = read_csv(file = "./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into=c("year", "month", "day"), sep="-") %>% 
  mutate( 
        year =  as.integer(year),
        month = as.numeric(month),
        month = month.abb[month],
        day = as.integer(day)) %>% 
  mutate(presidents = if_else(prez_gop >= 1, 'gop', 'dem')) %>%
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day) %>% 
  arrange(year,month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

### Second, clean the data in snp.csv in similar manner

``` r
# Import csv file, clean names, separate 'date' into 3 integer variables month, day, and year
# Remove variable 'day'
# Arrange snp dataset by year and month

snp_data = read_csv(file = "./data/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into=c("month", "day", "year"), sep="/") %>% 
  mutate( 
        month =  as.numeric(month),
        month = month.abb[month],
        day = as.integer(day),
        year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  arrange(year,month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

### Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous datasets

``` r
# Import unemployment csv
# Tidy unemployment data such that there's a year, month, and unemployment rate column
# Change year and month to integers
# Arrange unemployment dataset by year and month

unemployment = read_csv(file = "./data/unemployment.csv")%>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to="month",
    values_to="unemployment") %>%
   janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    year=as.integer(year)
    ) %>% 
   arrange(year, month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

#### Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment into the result.

#### Name resulting dataset p2\_merged.

``` r
p2_merged = 
  left_join(politicians_data, snp_data, by = c("year", "month")) %>% left_join(unemployment, by=c("year", "month"))
```

#### Write a short paragraph about your datasets. Explain briefly what each dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

The **politicians dataset** (politicians\_data) contains data about the
numerical breakdown of republicans/democrats in Congress for each month
from 1947 to 2015. There are 822 observations in this dataset, and 9
variables, named year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem,
sen\_dem, rep\_dem, presidents. These variables capture the number of
governors, senators, and representatives in each month who are
republican and democrat, and which party the president belongs to for
each given month.

The **snp dataset** (snp\_data) contains the closing values of the S\&P
stock index for every month from 1950 to 2015. There are 787
observations in this dataset, and 3 variables, named month, year, close.

The **unemployment dataset** (unemployment) contains the US unemployment
percentage of every month from 1948 to 2015. There are 816 observations
in this dataset, and 3 variables, named year, month, unemployment.

The **resulting combined dataset** contains the unemployment
percentages, the closing S\&P stock index, and political party breakdown
of Congress/presidents for each month since 1947. However, it’s
important to note that this merged dataset only has **complete data**
for each month beginning in the year 1950, as this was the earliest year
that the S\&P data was available for.

## Problem 3

### First, load and tidy the Popular Baby Names data

In the loading and tidying process, I will clean the variable names such
that they are all lower case.

Then, I will make all values in my dataset uniformly lower case across
all years.

I also want there to only be 4 ethnicity categories:

  - asian and pacific islander

  - hispanic

  - black non hispanic

  - white non hispanic

So, I need to make sure that similar iterations of those categories get
recoded to one of my 4 categories.

Once I’ve done that, I also want to remove any duplicate rows.

For good measure, I’ll also order the dataframe by year.

``` r
pop_baby_names = 
  read_csv(file="./data/Popular_Baby_names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name),
    gender = str_to_lower(gender),
    ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity)
    )  %>% 
  mutate(
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "asian and paci", "asian and pacific islander"),
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "black non hisp", "black non hispanic"),
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "white non hisp", "white non hispanic")) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(year_of_birth)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

### Create table showing the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time.

``` r
library(knitr) # load knitr packages so we can print nice table.

olivia_popularity = (
  filter(pop_baby_names, childs_first_name=="olivia")) %>% 
  select(-gender, -count, -childs_first_name) %>%
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "year_of_birth", 
      values_from = "rank") %>% 
    knitr::kable() %>% 
    print()
```

    ## 
    ## 
    ## ethnicity                     2011   2012   2013   2014   2015   2016
    ## ---------------------------  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----
    ## asian and pacific islander       4      3      3      1      1      1
    ## black non hispanic              10      8      6      8      4      8
    ## hispanic                        18     22     22     16     16     13
    ## white non hispanic               2      4      1      1      1      1

### Produce a similar table showing the most popular name among male children over time.
